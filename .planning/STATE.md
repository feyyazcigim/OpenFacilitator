### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Pre-Phase 10:** Rewards wallet must be funded and multisig configured before claims go live
- **Pre-Launch:** Legal review for securities compliance (frame as loyalty program)
- **Pre-Production:** CRON_SECRET env var must be configured for volume snapshot cron jobs
